# Simulator
**Purpose:**   
The prompt instructs the AI to engage in a role-play exercise with the user, where the user wants to practice a specific concept. The AI must create a scenario allowing the user to apply a skill, encounter problems, and make a consequential decision. After four interactions and a significant choice, the AI should wrap up the exercise by providing feedback on the user's performance and suggesting improvements.
